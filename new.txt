Operations
v + v   -> adds values
v - v   -> subtracts values
- v     -> negates values
v * v   -> multiplies values
vv      -> multiplies values
v / v   -> divides values
v ^ v   -> raises v1 to the v2 (exponentation)
(v)     -> groups a value/expression

==========

The user enters an equation, and the following happens:

The interpreter first tokenizes the equation into the following
categories:
group    -> NO REGEX /\\(/
            Opening parenthesis, anything else, and a matching
            closing parenthesis. If parentheses are unmatched,
            an error is raised.
number   -> /\d+(.\d+)?|.\d+/
            Optionally one or more digits optionally followed
            by a period and one or more digits. The number must
            contain at least one digit.
operator -> /\+|-|\*|\/|\^/
            One of +, -, *, /, or ^ characters
variable -> /[a-z]/
            Exactly one lowercase letter
* spaces are ignored and other extra characters raise an error

Subtraction operators not subtracting anything (have no left value) are replaced with negation operators.

Any two values (numbers or variables )

It then splits the equation at the _lowest_ precedence operator
in the following list:
+ lowest
-
*
/
^
- 
() highest

The negation operator is highest precedence as it is easiest to
negate any negative numbers first, and then do calculations
rather than having to keep track of the negative.

The interpreter then takes both split sides, and:
 - If any side only has a value remaining, it adds the value as
    the respective child of the original operator.
 - If any side still has operators to resolve, it continues
    splitting it and appends the created tree as the respective
    child of the original operator.

This creates a tree, which would look similar to the following:

INPUT
(2+-3)*5*x

TREE
multiplication
   [group] (does not actually appear in the tree - only its child)
      addition
         2
         -3
   multiplication
      5
      x

Each operation in the tree is resolved, starting from the
bottom until solving is complete.

==========

To graph the equation, the program computes values for each point on the graph (anywhere on the graph, not just the function).
Then, it looks at the neighbors of each point. If at least two of the neighbors is of the opposite sign, it draws an 8 (large point)
However, this leaves large open areas in the graph, so if only one of the neighbors is of the opposite sign, it draws a * (small point)
This creates good graphs for most continuous functions, even though it creates somewhat "fat" lines.
Problems arise with discontinuous functions: Vertical lines are drawn at asymptotes and discontinuities even though they should not be.
